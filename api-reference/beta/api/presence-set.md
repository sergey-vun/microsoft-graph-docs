# Set presence

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

### Concept: presence sessions
A user could have multiple presence sessions as the user could be on multiple Teams clients (desktop, mobile and web). Each Teams client has an independent presence session and the user's presence is an aggregated status from all the sessions underneath.

Your application can have its own presence session and be able to update the status.

### Keep alive and timeout
A presence session has a timeout of 5 minutes, so the application needs to call this API before the timeout to keep alive, even if the presence has not changed since the last call.

If times out, the presence status would fade way in stages. For example an application has updated `Available/Available` but never makes a call to keep alive, the presence session would change to `Available/AvailableInactive` with the first timeout, then `Away/Away` with the second timeout, and finally `Offline/Offline` with the third timeout.

## Permissions
The following permission is required to call the API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions            |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- |
| Application     | Presence.ReadWrite.All |
